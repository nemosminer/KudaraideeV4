Additional features list, made possible by "MrPlus"
Speical Thankyou To "MrPlus" amazing work with the GUI, PLUS profit calculations & Earnings Tracking

   GUI
   
      Since version 3.0 NemosMiner has a GUI making it easy to configure and run.
	  Relies on config files. No need to edit bat files. Simply run NemosMiner-v3.0.bat (Not the .ps1) 
	  Set the config on the config tab, save, close, run
 
   prerun
   
      Ability to run a batch prior switching to a specific algo.
      For example, can be used to set per algo OC via nvidiaInspector
      Simply create a file named <AlgoName>.bat in prerun folder
      If <AlgoName>.bat does not exist, will try to launch prerun/default.bat
      Use overclock with caution

   ahashpoolplus / zergpoolplus / zpoolplus / blazepoolplus
   
      Uses calculations based on 24hractual and currentestimate ahashpool prices to get more realistic estimate.
      Includes some trust index based on past 1hr currentestimate variation from 24hr.
      AND is NOT sensible to spikes.
      This shows less switching than following Current Estimate and more switching that following the 24hr Actual.
      Better profitability.

   Earnings Tracking
   
      Displays BTC/H and BTC/D as well a estimation of when the pool payment threshold will be reached.
      Supported pools:
            ahashpool
            zergpool
            zpool
            nicehash
      If mining more that one pools, shows stats for any supported pool
      Press key e in the console window to show/hide earnings

   Algo switching log
   
      Simple algo switching log in csv switching.log file found in Logs folder.
      You can easily track switching rate.

   Pools variants

      24hr - uses last 24hour Actual API too request profit
         -Low switching rate
      plus - uses advanced calculations to maximize profit
         -Best switching rate
      normal - uses current estimate API too request profit
         -High switching rate

   Console Display Options
   
      Use -UIStyle Light or -UIStyle Full in config.json
            Full = Usual display (Default)
            Light = Show only currently mining info 
      UIStyle automaticaly swtiches to Full during benchmarking.

   In session console display toggle
   
      Press key s in the window to switch between light and full display
      Press key e in the window to show/hide earnings 
      Will toggle display at next refresh

   New version notification
   
      NemosMiner will notify new version availability

https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=40784

CCMiner may need 'VCRUNTIME140.DLL' if you don't already have it:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145

running multiple cards its recommended to increase Virtual Memory 64gb is optimal

Requires nvidia driver newer than 388

Made For & Tested with 6x10603gb 6x1070 6x1070ti 6x1080ti (users have reported up to 12cards working have not tested myself)
Some miners do not support more that 9 cards
